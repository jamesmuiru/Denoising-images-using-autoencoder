# Denoising-images-using-autoencoder
Autoencoders are a type of artificial neural network used for unsupervised learning tasks, particularly for feature extraction and data representation. Here’s a breakdown of how they work and what they’re used for:
Key Points:
Neural Network-Based:
Autoencoders are built using neural networks. They are designed to learn an efficient representation (encoding) of input data without requiring labeled data (unsupervised learning).
Encoder and Decoder:
Encoder: The encoder compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation (latent space). This step reduces the complexity of the data.
Decoder: The decoder takes the compressed data from the encoder and tries to reconstruct the original input. The goal is to have the reconstructed data as close as possible to the original data.
Together, these two parts form the autoencoder model, learning how to compress data (encode) and then reconstruct it (decode).
Compact Representation:
The latent space or bottleneck layer in the network is where the autoencoder stores the compressed (or "encoded") version of the data. The smaller size of this layer forces the network to learn the most important features of the data.
Applications:
Image Denoising: Autoencoders can be trained to remove noise from images. The encoder learns to extract the clean features, while the decoder reconstructs the denoised image.
Anomaly Detection: Autoencoders can detect anomalies in data. Since they are trained to reconstruct "normal" data, when they encounter anomalous or unusual data, the reconstruction error will be high, making it possible to detect anomalies.
Visual Representation:
Input → Encoder (compress) → Latent Space (compact representation) → Decoder (reconstruct) → Output (reconstructed input)
In essence, autoencoders are powerful tools for learning efficient representations of data and are commonly applied in tasks that involve data compression, noise reduction, and outlier detection.
